# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project is a **machine learning-based crop recommendation system** that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental parameters such as **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **Temperature**, **Humidity**, **pH**, and **Rainfall**.
